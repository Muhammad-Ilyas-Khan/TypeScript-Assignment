// 14. Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
var guestList = ["William Shakespeare", "Jane Austen", "Charles Dickens", "George Orwell", "Emily Bronte"];
for (var i = 0; i < guestList.length; i++) {
    var message = "Dear ".concat(guestList[i], ", you are cordially invited to a dinner at my place. It would be an honor to have you join us for a wonderful evening of conversation and good food.");
    console.log(message);
}
